*I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.
— Blade Runner*

An animated sci-fi SVG scene demo using [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/gsap) heavily inspired by Blade Runner.
